# 💡Self introduction

- 📝 I’m @fcjz.
- 📑 I am interested in almost everything, love to try new things, love to learn and create.
- 📄 I am a student, but only a small part of my time is spent on my studies, most of the time I am obsessed with researching things that interest me.
- 📃 I have no need to seek cooperation. I just signed up for GitHub to have fun, so you can see that I did not write my readme file very carefully. It is the same as the contact information below. If you have anything, please go to my knowledge base. Find me with the blog and explain your purpose.
- 📰 I don't have a common social account, and I don't often check the exchanges on GitHub. If you have anything, please leave a message on my blog or knowledge base to explain your purpose.
- 📓I've always been on the fringes of the Internet, maybe you'll find me in a little corner, but I'm not without a home, I also have some fixed habitats, the links are below, which includes my blog and knowledge base.

# 📋SNS

Hey, I finally have a regular social media account in qoto.org (a mastodon instance).

Originally, I was still inconvenienced by social in blogs and knowledge bases. They are supposed to be places for me to record knowledge and summarize experiences. They should not be used as a social occasion to say unrelated things, although I do need a comment feature to communicate article content with friends.

Contact me at mastodon in the future, I will check the private message and reply in time (as long as you do not use a blocked server and do not post harassing messages and advertisements)
